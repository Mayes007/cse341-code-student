        <h2>Why These Quotes Matter</h2>
        <p>
          The quotes from Anakin and Leia show that both characters are driven by
          emotion, leadership, and a deep sense of purpose. Anakin’s words often
          reveal his internal struggle and descent into darkness, while Leia’s
          words inspire hope and strength in others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though they take different paths, their words reflect similar core
          traits: passion, loyalty, and the desire to protect others.
